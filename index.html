      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <div id="history-text">
        <p>Founded in 1963, Adler Publishing House began as a small family-run press in New York City, devoted to showcasing emerging voices in fiction and cultural criticism. In its early years, Adler published a series of now-iconic essay collections that helped define a generation of American intellectualism.</p>
      
        <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Adler expanded its reach to include translated works, poetry, and academic nonfiction, earning a reputation for editorial integrity and artistic risk. While many independent presses consolidated, Adler remained fiercely autonomous, guided by a commitment to authorship over all.</p>
      
        <p>Today, Adler Publishing House continues to champion distinctive storytelling. We publish across genres — from political memoirs to experimental fiction — and remain a platform for writers who challenge conventions and deepen our understanding of the world.</p>
